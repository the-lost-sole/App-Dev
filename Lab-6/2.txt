To design an HTML form that consists of the following fields and a SUBMIT button (Emp Name, Emp ID, DOB, Department, Salary, Email ID) and write a generic servlet program to retrieve all the form parameter names and their corresponding values and display them in the servlet window, you can follow the steps below:

Create an HTML form with the required fields and a submit button.
Specify the method attribute of the form tag as “post” to send the form data as an HTTP POST request to the server1.
In the servlet, use the getParameterNames() method of the HttpServletRequest object to retrieve all the parameter names of the form2.
Use the getParameter() method of the HttpServletRequest object to retrieve the value of each parameter2.
Display the parameter names and their corresponding values in the servlet window.
